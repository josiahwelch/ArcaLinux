# ArcaLinux
Arca Linux is a Linux distribution that is designed to be independent from the influence of major projects, corporations, and other entities.

## Future Plans

### Near Future
For future releases, I plan:
- To replace Systemd with a different init system (probably OpenRC)
- To fully implement ArcaDM once mature
- To add full X server support (actually XLibre, if possible)
- Depature from dependence on the LFS project

### Long-term Goals
In the distant future, I plan:
- To replace GNU utils with a different utility set (probably ubase and sbase from Suckless)
  - Potentially write my own POSIX-compliant utility set? (would really suck)
- To replace the Linux kernel with another compatible 64-bit kernel like FreeBSD's kernel
- Target other platforms (like the ARM architecture)
